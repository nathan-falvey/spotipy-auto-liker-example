# Spotipy-Auto-Liker-Example

This repository shows off a basic example of the Spotipy API. In this example, any song the user is playing, will be added to their liked songs after a certain percent of the song has been played. Note a prebuilt Spotify app is required from [here](https://developer.spotify.com).
